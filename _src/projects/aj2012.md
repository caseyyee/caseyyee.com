# Air Jordan 2012

The AJ2012 site was created to promoting Nike’s Air Jordan 2012 basketball shoe. I was central in providing creative, technology, and development direction for the campaign. The site received numerous awards, immense traffic, and pioneered new front-end web-design techniques in responsiveness, animation, and web performance never before seen at the time.
