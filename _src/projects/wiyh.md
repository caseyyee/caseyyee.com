# Word in Your Hand

## Booth experience for Johnson & Johnson

I custom designed the experience and marketing campaign for trade-show booths for Johnson &amp; Johnson. Visitors drew on their hands what diabetes meant to them.

* Designed, produced, and engineered of “hand” photo-booth system with user-selectable background colours.
* Visual displays of latest hand captures were displayed around the booth kiosk.
* Each capture also included email copies and physical print keepsakes.
