# 2025 Web Stack ðŸ¥ž

## OK, let's hear it. What do you like?

This is a work in progress. I'll add to it as I go.

May contain hot-takes.

## Front-end frameworks

No fuss, fast option is Vite. Great for quick prototypes and testing ideas. I'd like to try Astro for its ability to generate SEO friendly, easy to host static sites. For everything else, next.js has a lot of nice features. Server rendering, API routes are nice.

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Astro](https://astro.build/)

## State Management

Store state in URL for anything that you want to survive a refresh or share as a link. React-Query to
React useState, Context and useReducer is my goto. But using these can potentially lead to a lot of headaches with when things get more complex. Xstate is great for state machines. Zustand for everything else.

  - Client side data fetching and caching

- [Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/)

## Type-safe data

End-to-end type-safety. We've come a long way from Javascript.

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)

## Styling & Motion

Tailwind makes every other styles system feel slow and clumsy. For more sophisicated animation, Framer Motion is where it's at. For ultimate control, GSAP is OG and good. styled-components can eat my shorts.

- [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/icons/)

## Forms

Most boring part of making apps.

- [React hook form](https://react-hook-form.com/)

## Testing

It's not just to keep code from breaking. But also necessary for feature development where conditions for functionality to work can be difficult to reproduce. Mocking data and tests are the only tools in these situation to reliably develop against.

- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

## Errors & Monitoring

Sentry has saved my bacon more than once.

- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/)
- [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/)

## 3D

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction)
- [Unity 3D](https://unity.com/)

## Cross-platform Native

Honestly react-native development is kind of a pain. But would you rather learn Swift? Ya, maybe one day.

- [Expo](https://expo.dev/)

## Code Form

- See `.dotfiles` for configuration.
- See `.cursorrules` file.

- 2 spaces, no tabs.
  Tabs vary in width depending on where youre viewing code, what font you use. Spaces are consistent and don't make your cursor jump around.

### Linting & Formatting

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
