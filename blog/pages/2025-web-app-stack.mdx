## What helped me move faster, more efficiently, and ship higher quality products in the last year. Here is the tech and patterns I would choose when starting my next project.

<img src={katamari} alt="katamari" />

This is a work in progress. I plan on updating from time to time.

May contain hot-takes.

## Front-end frameworks

Zero-to-hero with no fuss and fast? Go with Vite. For more complex apps, Server rendering, Route and API handling, Next.js is hard to beat.

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

## State Management

Keeping it simple with queryStrings, useState and React Context is still my preferred approach. For more complex or larger state, I'd look to Xstate and Zustand.

- [Xstate](https://xstate.js.org/)
- [Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/)

## Styling & Motion

Tailwind makes every other styles system feel slow and clumsy. For more sophisicated animation, Framer Motion is where it's at. For ultimate control, GSAP is OG but goody. styled-components can eat my shorts.

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/icons/)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/)

## Type-safe data

End-to-end type-safety. We've come a long way from Javascript.

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)

## Forms

Most boring part of making apps.

- [React hook form](https://react-hook-form.com/)

## Testing

It's not just to keep code from breaking. But also necessary for feature development where conditions for functionality to work can be difficult to reproduce. Mocking data and tests are the only tools in these situation to reliably develop against.

- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

## Errors & Monitoring

Sentry has saved my bacon more than once.

- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/)
- [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/)

## 3D

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction)
- [Unity 3D](https://unity.com/)

## Cross-platform Native

- [Expo](https://expo.dev/)

## Code Form

### Tabs or spaces

2 spaces, no tabs.

Tabs vary in width depending on where youre viewing code, what font you use. Spaces are consistent and don't make your cursor jump around.

### Linting & Formatting

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
