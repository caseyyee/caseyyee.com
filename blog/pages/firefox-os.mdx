# Firefox OS

[Firefox OS](https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/25/firefox-os-gives-the-open-web-gets-central-billing/) is an open-source mobile operating system built entirely from Open Web technologies by [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/).

I arrived early in the project and helped design and prototype many of the core user experience of the OS.

- User flows and interaction design for key applications including Email, Calendar, Photo, Contacts, and the Lockscreen
- Designed UX and UI patterns for system-level Notifications, Permissions, and Dialogues
- Co-created Firefox OS design system and UI style guide
- Collaborated with external partners, including hardware vendors.
