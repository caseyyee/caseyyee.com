# Hypetrain

If like many of you, when i looked at getting into AI, i was overwhelmed by how different working with it was than what i was used to in web development land. In a way, it feels like i completely slept on it, and when i finally looked, things have progressed so much, that i felt a certain panic. What is all this python code? Is there any chance of keeping up? So much maths. It just feels like a completely different world to me.

I will never be able to work on the frontier, those brains are too big for me. Also seems like the domain of big companies that can afford the compute for training.

Feeling like falling behind is real. Everyone seems to be integrating ai into their products, and endless amount of cruft on social media of accounts of new services being born what feels like every hour. The pace is relentless.

But as time has gone by, just taking the time to understand the landscape a bit has helped me understand, that we're still early in this.

# Incorporating AI into your development workflow

whats worked well:
Chatbots are the obvious starting point. They are everywhere and in their most basic form can be extremely helpful in your day to day. Some of the ways i've found them useful in my workflow are:

- Looking up API usage
- Ideas on approachees for solving code problems

What i've found that even this basic level of usage has made me a much more efficient developer. Rather than getting stuck for days on a problem, I can usually get them figured out in a few hours. Lower frustration, higher productivity, and generally more enjoyable.

What its not good at:

Helucinations are real. Lots of just plain wrong answers. Mostly in the form of API functions that don't exist.
