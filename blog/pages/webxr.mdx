# WebXR Content Tools

The challenge for WebXR, is to get people creating content. To solve this, I helped create a number of tools and experiences that helped kickstart interest in creating WebVR content. We also used these tools for our own explorations and prototypes.

## üïπ Unity WebVR Assets

The [Unity WebVR Assets](https://github.com/mozilla/unity-webvr-export) were built to make it easy for VR content creators using Unity, a popular game-development platform, to export their experiences to WebVR. The goal was to have content, which was already available on native, brought over to help make more WebVR content available.

## üÖ∞Ô∏è A-Frame

<img src={markup} alt="Source code of A-Frame‚Äôs ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù example project" />

The main design goal of [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) was to create a simple, and easy to use library that would allow anyone to create WebVR content with just simple HTML markup. The library was built on top of [three.js](https://threejs.org/) and uses web components with [Custom Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements).

## üéöüéõ A-Frame UI widgets

One of the most challenging areas of VR is designing interactions that are easy to understand and use. I built the [_UI Widgets_ A-Frame components](https://github.com/caseyyee/aframe-ui-widgets/) to provide a starting set of controls that model physical controls that one would be familiar with using in the real world.

## üåê WebVR Browser API

The [WebVR browser API](https://immersive-web.github.io/webvr/spec/1.1/) makes it possible for web pages can use JavaScript to access a VR headset‚Äôs headset &amp; controller orientation &amp; position data, then using that data to render the appropriate stereoscopic views using WebGL into the VR headset. I helped with the early design and testing in its earliest stages with [Kearwood ‚ÄúKip‚Äù Gilbert](https://twitter.com/kearwoodgilbert) (Mozilla), [Chris Van Wiemeersch](https://twitter.com/cvanw) (Mozilla), and [Brandon Jones](https://twitter.com/tojiro) (Google).

### Early CSS-VR explorations

Encouraged by incredible work like [Tridiv](http://tridiv.com/) and [CSS-FPS](https://keithclark.co.uk/labs/css-fps/) by [Keith Clark](keithclarkcouk), we experimented with using CSS as a way to render WebVR content.

The [Horizon web browser](#horizon) interface was built exclusively from CSS-VR.

## ‚òî _Puzzle Rain_ experience

{' '}

<img src={puzzleRain} alt="Puzzle Rain" />

[_Puzzle Rain_](https://mixedreality.mozilla.org/puzzle-rain/) is a musical journey in which you help awaken and guide mythical creatures back together into happy musical harmony with one another. Only their combined musical chorus can summon life-giving rain to revive the parched and desolate landscape. Though, there isn‚Äôt much time. Dangerous predators roam!

This experience was a collaboration between [Arturo Paracuellos](http://unboring.net/) and Mozilla.

## üé® Sketch2three

<img src={sketch2three} alt="Sketch2three" />

One of the earliest challenges facing us when creating UI was that lack of tools for designing 2D layouts in VR. To solve this, I created a workflow tool that enabled designers to quickly iterate designs in Sketch and then view/edit them within the browser via WebVR.

This lead to extremely quick results that allowed us to quickly iterate over several designs for various VR browser explorations, such as [HIRO](#hiro), [Horizon](#horizon), and other early incarnations of VR web-browser concepts.
