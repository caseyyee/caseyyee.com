<h2>Virtual Reality Web Browser</h2>


<h3>The virtual reality Web and why designers should be involved.</h3>


<p>With the introduction of Virtual Reality in the form of the Oculus Rift, launched as a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2012, it was clear to a small group of us at Mozilla that this was a important and ground-breaking technology that we needed to explore. The ability to be able to immerse yourself into a completely digital world was not a new idea and has been a fanticised about for decades in science fiction and anime. These in-fact were pioneered and explored for decades up to this point in various University labs. but the fact that it was being offered as a device that was available to the average consumer at prices never before seen, was a cue that maybe, we are seeing a start to a major shift in the ability for this tecnology to be accessible to your average consumers and put to real use and spur a revolution in design, technology and my personal interest, how we interact with information, data, and eachother in the future.</p>

<p>Putting on the headset, I was immediately struck by the ability to see objects drawn our in front of me stereoscopically, which gave a sense of volume that I had never before seen. You can describe what you were seeing in terms that were different than you would associate with traditional computer displays. What you were seeing could be described in size, volume and orientation, and in fact feeling and emotion tied to the space (or lack of) and environment created within the headset.</p>

<p>Indeed, we have seen some adoption of the technolgy through a almost inveitable boom and subsequent "bust" of VR technology, but VR continues to rage on and despite many sentiments, there continues to be growth and investment into the space with major players investing heavily into developing the tecnology and the applications for VR.</p>



the web needed to play a role in this future.  At it's basic level, you need to still be able to access the web just as you have been for the last several decades, and so a browser needs to be built to accomodate that.  




and the momentum continues to grow, but experiences would be dominated by tools that catered to the development of game software rather than web development.  The patterns, design and skillset needed to work on VR content 






that the web needed to be part of this new ground breaking technology, and we set out to figure out how 
Firefox Reality is a Virtual Reality web browser built to run on mobile VR headsets like the Oculus Go.
