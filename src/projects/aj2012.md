# Air Jordan 2012

The AJ2012 site was a project that I was instrumental in providing creative, technology and engineering direction, and was created to promoting Nike’s Air Jordan 2012 basketball shoe. This site picked up numerous awards and pioneered new techniques in responsive, animation and web performance never before seen on the web.
