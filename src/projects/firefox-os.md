# Firefox OS

Firefox OS is a open-source, smartphone OS built entirely from Web technologies by Mozilla.

I arrived early in the project, and design, prototype and implement many of the decisions around the core user experience of the OS.

* UI styles, guides and UI kit.
* Prototype various design explorations around lock and homescreen designs.
* User flows and interaction design for key applications including Email, Calendar, Photo, Contacts.
* Notification, permissions, dialogues and other core system UX.
* Collaborated and worked with partners from various vendors.
