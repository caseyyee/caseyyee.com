Firefox OS is a open-source, smartphone OS built entirely from Web technologies by Mozilla.

I arrived early in the project and helped design and prototype many of the core user experience of the OS.

* User flows and interaction design for key applications including Email, Calendar, Photo, Contacts.
* Notification, permissions, dialogues and other core system UX.
* UI styles, guides and kit.
* Explored and prototype various designs around lock screen.
* Collaborated and worked with partners from various vendors.
