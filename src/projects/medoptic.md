## VR in training

Medical training is a highly specialized activity, for any given procedure there is a limited amount of expertise. This means that training is very centralized, often requiring travel, added risk factors in the OR and logistical difficulties with timing, equipment and availability. And as a result, limits opportunities for training.

The Medoptic platform specifically targets to make medical training more scalable, accessible and cost effective than in-person training. The platform utilizes high-performance 6K Stereoscopic VR Video streaming, highly collaborative multi-user environments and a telemetry package to track user engagement and training outcomes.

Additionally, the platform also includes the ability to integrate multiple cameras, medical instrumentation, device views and data to provide an advanced view into how decisions are made during procedures.
