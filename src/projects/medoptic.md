## VR in training

Medical training is a highly specialized activity, for any given procedure there is a limited amount of expertise. This means that training is very centralized often requiring travel, added risk factors in the OR and logistical difficulties with timing, equipment and availability. And as a result, limits opportunities for training.

The Medoptic platform specifically targets to make medical training more scaleable, accessible and cost effective than in-person training. The platform utilizes high-performance 6K Stereoscopic VR Video streaming, highly collaborative multi-user environments and a telemetry package to track user engagement and training outcomes.

Additionally, the platform also includes the ability to integrate multiple cameras, medical instrumentation, device views and data to provide a advanced view into how decisions are made during procedures.
