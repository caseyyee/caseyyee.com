# Vancouver Film School

## _Digital Design_ program and _OOMPF_

At [VFS](https://vfs.edu/), I developed and taught the _Web Design_, _Physical Computing_, and _Foundational UX_ courses. As part of the [Digital Design](https://vfs.edu/programs/digital-design) programâ€™s marketing initiatives, I also built the [_OOMPH_](http://community.vfs.com/oomph/) site portal to showcase student works and achievements.
